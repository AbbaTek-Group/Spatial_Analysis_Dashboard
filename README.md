# Spatial Analysis and Visualization of B.C. Protected and Conserved Areas

This repository contains R code that uses spatial data to gegerate an interactive map and data visualization that communicates the distribution of different types of protected and conserved areas in B.C., both terrestrial and marine. It is meant to be an updated version of the core State of Environment (SoE) indicator [Protected Lands and Waters in B.C.](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/indicators/land/protected-lands-and-waters.html)
